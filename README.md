This repository was made to illustrate a strange behavior we found on Azure ARM Template. A function app is deployed from the source control (GitHub), at the end of the deployment a function named Setup is called to finish the deployment. Problem is that the Listsecret function is resolved before the function is actually deployed, and so it trigger a File Not Found exception. We managed to bypass the issue by using an external template as shown [here](https://github.com/loriot/AzureSolutionTemplate)
